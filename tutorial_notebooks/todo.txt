This fruits data is kinda bad. I'm going to go ahead and follow this kaggle notebook
and finish the training script with it: https://www.kaggle.com/code/yerramvarun/fine-tuning-faster-rcnn-using-pytorch

Full circle, but the best way to do this is to clone the torchvision repo and use it like it is used
in all the articles you see online.

Really doesn't matter about the tutorial stuff. I can keep going down that path. Just finish the training on
the fruits dataset first and then the license plates/cars. Come back and flesh out the rest of the tutorial
on the fruits dataset if I really want to.
