Listing the changes that will need to be made to the notebooks after I finish

Dataset is changing. I am going to resize the images to the scale of the inputs required by the torch model
we are using. I need to reflect that change in the notebook. Most everything should be okay, just the resize
needs to be reflected.

Model itself. Changing from using torchvision over to using timm. It's a lot easier and makes more sense.
